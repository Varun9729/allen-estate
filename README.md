#### ⚠⚠⚠This project has NOT reach version 1.0.0 yet⚠⚠⚠
File structure, apis, and file names may change till we reach beta.


## Getting Started

This project depends on the [`build_runner`](https://pub.dev/packages/build_runner) package for code generation, make sure to run `pub run build_runner build` on the root directory otherwise the project won't built as auto-generated files are not checked into VCS. 

After files has been generated by running `build_runner build` you may proceed as any othe regular flutter project.

## App Architecture 🏨📏
* MVVM architecture
* Each layer only depends on the layer below
* Locator pattern is achieved by using [`get_it`](https://pub.dev/packages/get_it) package
* Data binding is achieved by using `ChangeNotifier` class and [`provider`](https://pub.dev/packages/provider) package

The **iu** folder contains all the flutter code, the only folder that depends on the **core** business logic is in lib>ui>containers, you may consider it as the glue between the business logic and the presentation layer
